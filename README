This module is used to manage selinux stuff. Currently we mainly
use it to manage selinux stuff on centos, however there are as well
some funtions for other distros.

Local modifications by gadavis@ucsd.edu to work on RedHat and set
selinux into permissive mode until system can be rebooted

Module Requirements:
* https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib as stdlib

Optional:
* https://github.com/duritong/puppet-munin.git as munin - for optional
  Munin integration
